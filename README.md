# Raspberry Pi Audio Logger

## Overview
This project transforms a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W into a field-deployable audio recording and highlight-logging device. It continuously records microphone input, logs highlight windows via button press, and uploads all data to a remote web server at regular intervals.

---

## Features

- **Continuous audio recording** in 30-minute chunks
- **Highlight logging**: capture 2 minutes before + 5 minutes after button press
- **Automatic and manual upload** to a web server
- **LED status indicator**:
  - Solid Green: Recording
  - Pulsing Green: Highlight window active
  - Pulsing Blue: Uploading
  - Solid Red: Error state
- **Auto-deletes old recordings** after upload to save space
- **Headless bootable setup** from SD card

## Hardware Required

- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
- INMP441 I2S Microphone
- Common Cathode RGB LED (with 3x 330Î© resistors)
- 2x Push Buttons
- 18650 Battery (or USB power)
